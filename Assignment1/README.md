# Assignment 1: Cache implement
My assignment 1 in DSA semester 213

## Student Outcomes
After completing this assignment, students will be able to
* explain how a cache works
* apply BST tree to search in a simple cache

## Cache replacement Policies
As the size of a cache is limited, when the cache is full and a new data is
inserted into the cache for future requests, an existing data in the cache must
be selected by the cache replacement policy and it is removed to have place for
the new data. There are many cache replacement policies, all the below policies will be use in 2 assignments:
* FIFO (First In First Out)
* LIFO (Last In First Out)

## Run testcase

To run testcase
```C++
make all
